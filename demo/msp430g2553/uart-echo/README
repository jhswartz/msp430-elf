PREPARATION

  This demonstration assumes that you have a functional MSP430G2553
  installed in a MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad, and attached to your host
  via a +-3.3V UART interface.
        
  Ensure that the following connections are established.

    Host GND ----  MSP430G2553 GND
    Host TX  ----  MSP430G2553 P1.1 (RX)
    Host RX  ----  MSP430G2553 P1.2 (TX)


BUILD

  Make sure that msp430-elf-as and msp430-elf-ld are accessible.

    $ AS=msp430-elf-as LD=msp430-elf-ld LDFLAGS="-T msp430g2553.ld"  make


PROGRAM

  Substitute rf2500 with the appropriate driver, if need be.
 
    $ mspdebug rf2500 "prog uart-echo"


TEST

  Substitute /dev/ttyUSB0 with the device node associated your host's
  UART interface, if required.

    $ socat - /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0,b19200
    QUACK! QUACK!
    QUACK! QUACK!
    ^C
